      <h2>Hi, we are Collaby!</h2>
      <p>
        Collaby is a social media start up company managed entirely on the
        internet. We provide the perfect space for groups of people across the
        world to build their own Collabed together. Collabs are essentially
        group pages where group members can drag and drop information they most
        care about unto their Collaby page space to share with their entire
        group. This helps groups to better manage their content as well as easy
        collaboration and community building with in their webpage.

      <p>
        Collaby strives to provide groups of people around the world their own
        virtual space on the internet where they can share with their members
        content they care about most. HTML5 elements that easy to create and
        organize through dragging and dropping is one of the ways we approach
        our mission. We strongly feel that an overall easy to use process for
        all groups to create their page. Is something that will help foster the
        spirit of creativity and collaboration for all groups on Collaby. We
        continue to develop and work on features that will add to the overall
        easy to use experience our community deserves.
